## Project description

This program generates a food menu from some popular restaurants for the user to choose from. The user can choose where they would like to eat and choose their items. After this they will head to checkout and pay for their items. Once completed the user will have the option to leave a review or look at previous reviews. 



## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash

```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

This program uses a command line interface. The program outputs a menu and the user will interact with it by entering in responses based upon the screen's prompts.
